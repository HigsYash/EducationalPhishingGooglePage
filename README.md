# Hello fellow lerners,

I have created a repository for educational purposes in ethical hacking.

Here we have a php file which is login page where user can put the data and login. The login however redirect the user on the same page.
There is also a text file and a config.php file. Config where get the form action from the index file and add the information into the 
txt file here the data get stored.

Please do not use this in any illegal way, Phising is illegal.

Note: Anything you do with this file such as using this in your website or in any manner, if you get in trouble your are the responsible for it.

Regards,
Yash Bhati.
